This repo contains assignment codes and analysis for the Introduction to Data Science Lecture at NYU Center for Data Science. 
Below are the descriptions of code included in the repo. 

__Churn:__ Predicting customer churn for a telecom company using decision tree classifier.

__Higgs_Boson:__ In this assignment we look at data generated by particle physicists to test whether machine learning can help classify whether certain particle decay experiments identify the presence of a Higgs Boson. (Originally a Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson)

__Mandelbrot:__ A function for plotting the Mandelbrot Fractal using Mandelbrot Iteration.
